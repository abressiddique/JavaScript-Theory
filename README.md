Q. What is JavaScript
A: JavaScript is a high level, object oriented, multi-paradigm, programming language.
A: JavaScript is a High level, prototype based object oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or Just In Time Compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.


Low Level Languages: Developer has to manage resources manually. Faster Than High Level Languages.


High Level Languages: Developers don't manage resources manually, its automated. Slower than Low Level Languages.


JS can follow Procedural programming, Object oriented programming, and functional programming.
JS can follow both imperative and declarative paradigm.


First Class Functions => functions are treated as variables.


JavaScript is single Threaded => JavaScript runs in one single thread, so it can do one thing at a time.
In case of long running tasks, in order to achieve non-blocking behaviour, JavaScript engine uses an event loop, executing the long tasks in the "background", and puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.


Compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code and written to a binary file, and then executed.

Interpretation: Line by line execution of the code.

Just In Time(JIT) Compilation: Entire code is converted into machine code at once, then executed immediately.
Code --> Parsing --> Compilation --> Execution --> Optimization --> Compilation --> Execution -->... JS engine creates an unoptimized version of machine code and executes immediately, at the same time keeps optimizing the machine code and replaces the current code with better optimized versions of the code making it extremely fast.

```
JS Runtime In The Browser
1. Heap - JS Engine
2. Call Stack - JS Engine
3. Web Apis -> DOM, Timers, Fetch APIs, etc.
4. Callback Queue -> onClick, timer, data, etc.
5. Event Loop.

JS Runtime In Node.js
1. Heap - JS Engine
2. Call Stack - JS Engine
3. Libuv (C++ Bindings & Thread Pool)
4. Callback Queue -> onClick, timer, data, etc.
5. Event Loop.
```

Execution
1. Creation of global execution context(for top level code (code that is not inside a function)). Exactly one gloabl execution context.
2. Execution of top level code inside global execution context.
3. Execution of functions and waiting for callbacks. one execution context per function.


Inside Execution Context - Generated during creation phase - right before  execution
1. Variable Environment - values inside the context eg. let, const, functions, argument objects etc.
2. Scope change
3. this keyword
Arrow Functions dont have their own this keyword and argument objects and they inherit it from their parent.


this keyword:
1. created for every execution context.
2. this is NOT static.

```
In JS every value is either an object or a primitive value.

7 Data Types In JS
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Symbol
7. BigInt (ES2020)
```

JS has dynamic typing => Data types are determined automatically. In JS, value has the type, not the variable. Variables simply store the value.


let is block scoped, var is function scoped. Avoid using var, use const as default and let when the value of the variable may change after initialisation.

Type conversion is when we manually convert from one type to another, where as type coercion is when JavaScript automatically converts one type to another behind the scenes.

Falsy Values are values that on conversion to boolean will return false
JS has 5 falsy Values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN
Rest of the values are truthy values -> on conversion to boolean will return true

== while comparing does type  coercion, while === doesn't. Avoid using ==, always use ===


Expression is a piece of code that produces some value

Statements are complete lines of code that doesn't produce value and translate to actions in a program--> Expressions are generally a part of statements.


JS is Backwards Compatible, not forwards compatible

In JS, functions are just values which can be stored in variables

function declaration can be accessed from a line even before its declaration where as function expression can only be called after its declaration.
```
function declaration
function calcAge(){}

function expression
const calcAge = function(){}
const calcAge = () => {}
```

Everything in JS is a value and nearly everything in JS is an object other than the 7 data types — null , undefined , strings, numbers, boolean, symbols and BigInt (These are primitive values or primitive data types).

DOM: Document Object Model is a structured representation of HTML documents. It allows JavaScript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.

DOM Methods and Properties are not part of JS language. They are part of Web Apis which interact with JS.

The Spread Operator(...) takes all elements from the array and also doesn't create new variables, hence we can only use it where we would otherwise write values separated by commas.
```
Helps creating shallow copies of an array.
// Copy Array
const newArray = [...originalArray];
// Join 2 Arrays
const newArray = [...array1, ...array2];
```
Spread operator only works with iterables.
Iterables: arrays, strings, maps, sets
Non-Iterables: objects

Spread operator was introduced in es6.
From es2018, spread operator also works on objects even though they are not iterables.
```
// Creating A new object using key value pairs of the old object while adding new key value pairs
const newObject = {...originalObject, founder: Abhi, date:'2022'};

//Creating A Shallow Copy Of An Object
const newObject = {...originalObject};

Accessing Key Value Pairs In An Object
// 1) for...in
var user = {
    name : "John",
    age  : 25
}
for(const property in user) {
    console.log(`user[${property}] = ${user[property]}`);
}
//output
user[name] = John
user[age]  = 25

// 2) for...of
var user = {
    name : "John",
    age  : 25
}
let entries = Object.entries(user);
for(const [prop, val] of entries) {
    console.log(prop, val);
}

// 3) map
var user = {
    name : "John",
    age  : 25
}
let entries = Object.entries(user);
entries.map( ([prop, val]) => console.log(prop, val));

// 4) forEach
var user = {
    name : "John",
    age  : 25
}
let entries = Object.entries(user);
entries.forEach( ([prop, val]) => console.log(prop, val));

// 5) Another way
const entries = Object.entries(originalObject);

for(const[key, value] of entries){
    console.log(key, value);
}

// 6) Accessing Only Values In An Object
const values = Object.values(originalObject);
console.log(values)
```

```
// SPREAD, because on right side of =
const arr = [1, 2, ...[3,4]];
console.log(arr) --> [1, 2, 3, 4]

// REST(rest operator), because on left side of =
const [a, b, ...others] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(a, b, others) --> 1 2 [3, 4, 5]

Rest operator does not include skipped elements.
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [a, , b, ...newArray] = arr;
console.log(a, b, newArray) --> 1 3 [4,5]
```
There can only be one rest operator in any destructuring assignment.
```
Rest operator also works with objects and functions.
// Example of Rest Operator In Use
const add = function(...numbers){
    let sum = 0;
    for(let num of numbers){
        sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
}
add(2, 3);
add(2, 3, 4, 5);
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
add(...arr);
```
Logical Operators can use any data type, return any data type in JavaScript.
They perform Short Circuit Evaluation

ShortCircuiting: If the first value is a truthy value, it will immediately return the first value without even checking the second value
```
// If any one is truthy -> return truthy value
console.log(3 || 'Abhi') --> 3
console.log('' || 'Abhi') --> Abhi
console.log(true || 0) --> true
console.log(undefined || null) --> null

// If any one is falsy --> return falsy value
console.log(0 && 'Abhi') --> 0
console.log(7 && 'Abhi') --> Abhi (In case of both value being truthy, return the last truthy value)

Nullish: null and undefined (not 0 or '')
const newNumber = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10;
//if restaurant.numGuests is not nullish then the value will be assigned to newNumber else 10;

rest1.numGuests ||=10;
rest2.numGuests ||=10;
//if rest1.numGuests and rest2.numGuests are falsy then 10 will be assigned to them else their value will remain --> es21 feature

rest1.numGuests &&=10;
rest2.numGuests &&=10;
//if rest1.numGuests and rest2.numGuests are truthy then 10 will be assigned to them else their value will remain falsy --> es21 feature

rest1.numGuests ??=10;
rest2.numGuests ??=10;
//if rest1.numGuests and rest2.numGuests are nullish(only null or undefined) then 10 will be assigned to them else their value will remain --> es21 feature

Optional Chaining (es2020): if a certain property doesn't exist then undefined is returned immediately.
console.log(restaurant.openingHours.mon?.open);
//if .mon exists in the object restaurant then .open value will be returned else, undefined will be returned.
```

JavaScript has built in Data Structures for Sets and Maps.
```
Creating an array of unique values with Sets

const newArray = [...new Set(originalArray)];

// Iteration over sets
for(const num of sets){
    console.log(num);
}

Creating Map from an Object
const hoursMap = new Map(Object.entries(openingHours));

Iteration Over Maps
for(const [key, value] of question){
    console.log(key, value);
}
```
Both Sets and Maps don't store duplicate keys.



Default Parameters(es6)
```
const createBooking = function(flightNum, numPassengers = 1, price = 199 * numPassengers){
    .....
}
```

```
Replace spaces in a string
const oneWord = function(str){
    return str.replace(/ /g,'');
}
```
```
function returning function
const greet = function(greeting){
    return function(name){
        console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
    };
};

const greetHey = greet('Hey');
greetHey('Abhi');
// Output --> Hey Abhi

greet('hello')('Abhi');
// Output --> Hey Abhi
```
```
Immediately Invoked Function Expression
(function(){
    console.log('This will only run once');
})();
(() => console.log('This will only run once'))();
```

Closures:
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
```
// Example Of Closures
function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```
// Explanation Of The Code Above
init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init().



continue and break statements do not work in a forEach loop.

Important Array Methods => forEach, map, filter, reduce, at, slice, splice, find, findIndex, some, every, flat, flatMap, sort and fill.

First way of filling an array(old way)
```
const arr = new Array(7);
arr.fill(0);
```

Second way of filling an array(new way).
```
// Creating an array of length 7 and filling it with 0.
const arr = Array.from({length: 7}, () => 0);

// Creating array of length 7 and filling it with 1-7 numbers
const arr = Array.from({length: 7}, (currentElement. index) => index + 1);
```

JavaScript doesn't always give the correct solutions regarding mathematical operators, so be aware of it while solving DSA problems

```
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
console.log(0.2 + 0.3);
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);
console.log(Math.floor(0.1 + 0.2) === Math.floor(0.3));

// Output
// 0.30000000000000004
// 0.5
// false
// true

```
Converting String to Number
```
console.log(Number('23'));// Output -> 23
console.log(+'23');       // Output -> 23
Number.parseInt('23');    // Output -> 23
Number.parseInt('23px');  // Output -> 23
Number.parseInt('23.5');  // Output -> 23
Number.parseFloat('2.5'); // Output -> 2.5
Number.parseFloat('2.5rem'); // Output -> 2.5
```

Checking isNumber
```
console.log(Number.isNaN(20));
console.log(Number.isInteger(20));
console.log(Number.isFinite('20'));
// isFinite is the best Way To Check because it doesn't consider infinity to be true
```

Power of a number

```
console.log(25 ** 2); // Output: 25^2 = 625
console.log(25 ** 1/2); // Ouput sqrt(25) = 5
```

Important Math Methods In Js
Math.max, Math.min, Math.PI, Number.sqrt, Math.trunc, Math.random, Math.round(), Math.floor, Math.ceil, toFixed

es2021 => Numeric Seperators, for better representation of a number.
```
const diameter = 287_460_000_000;
console.log(diameter);
// Output: 287460000000
```


Largest Number In JS
```
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
console.log(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER);
```

es2020 => BigInt Primitive Data Type
add n at the end of the number to make it BigInt;
```
console.log(111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111n);
console.log(BigInt(192919))
// BigInt(variable) Should only be used with small numbers because JS has to internally store the number before passing it to BigInt
```
Operators work the same way with BigInt;
Mixing BigInt with regular numbers is not possible. We will have to convert the regular number to BigInt before applying operators.

```
console.log(20n === 20); // false
console.log(20n > 15); // true

const huge = 100000000000000000000000000000000000n;
console.log(huge + ' is Big');
// Output: 100000000000000000000000000000000000 is Big

console.log(10n/3n); // Output: 3n
console.log(10/3); // Output: 3.3333....
```

Passing parameters to setTimeout function
```
setTimeout((ing1, ing2) => console.log(ing1, ing2),
3000,
'Hello',
'there');

const words = ['Hello', 'there'];
setTimeout((ing1, ing2) => console.log(ing1, ing2),
3000,
...words);

```

Stopping the setTimeout function
```
const wordTimer = setTimeout((ing1, ing2) => console.log(ing1, ing2),
3000,
'Hello',
'there');

const words = ['Hello', 'there'];
setTimeout((ing1, ing2) => console.log(ing1, ing2),
3000,
...words);

if(words.includes('there')) clearTimeout(wordTimer);
```

Easier way of creating a smooth scroll in JavaScript
```
btnScrollTo.addEventListener('click', function(e){
    section1.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth'});
    });
```

DOM:
```
JS <-- DOM (Interface) --> Browser
```
1. Allows Interaction between JS code and Browser.
2. Allows JS code to create, modify, delete, set styles, classes, attributes, listen and respond.
3. DOM tree is generated from HTML document which the JS code can interact with to manipulate the website.
4. DOM is an API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM Tree.

Bubbling:
When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.


The standard DOM Events describes 3 phases of event propagation:

Capturing phase – the event goes down to the element.
Target phase – the event reached the target element.
Bubbling phase – the event bubbles up from the element.


Event Delegation is a pattern to handle events efficiently. Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element, we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on a particular target using the .target property of the event object.


Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.




4 Principles Of OOP
1. Abstraction: Hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing we are implementing, instead of messing with details that really don't matter to our implementation.
2. Encapsulation: Keeping properties and methods private inside the class so that they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API).
3. Inheritance: In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object or class, retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.
4. Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 

Objects are instantiated from a class, which are functions like a blueprint in JavaScript.
Instantiation is creation of instance from a class.


```
Prototypal Inheritance Delegation
Prototype (Contains Methods) <--- Object (Can Acess Methods)
```
Objects are linked to a prototype object.
Proptotypal Inheritance: The prototype contains methods (behaviour) that are accesible to all objects linked to that prototype.
Behaviour is delegated to the linked prototype object.

ES6 Classes are constructor functions with syntactical sugar, not actual classes.


Each object has a private property (referred to as its Prototype) that maintains a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has its own prototype, and so on until an object whose prototype is null is reached.

By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this chain of prototypes.

This is known as prototypical inheritance and differs from class inheritance.



Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.


Callback Function: A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. However, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed — these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as fetch().
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function that executes the callback based on the result. They are basically functions that are executed only after a result is produced. Callbacks are an important part of asynchronous JavaScript.

Inversion of control is the notion of having code under your control in one part of the program, then handing control over to a callback in another part of the program. Inversion of Control (IoC) is an abstract programming principle based on the flow of control (execution of statements/instructions) that should be fully managed by the specific implementation of the framework, which is external to your code.

Callback Hell: Callback Hell is essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. Every callback depends/waits for the previous callback, thereby making a pyramid structure that affects the readability and maintainability of the code. 

We can avoid the callback hell with the help of Promises. Promises in javascript are a way to handle asynchronous operations. It allows us to return a value from an asynchronous function like synchronous functions. When we return something from an asynchronous method it returns a promise which can be used to consume the final value when it is available in the future with the help of then() method or await inside of async functions.

```
// 1) First solution to callback hell: Write comments
// Makes a burger
// makeBurger contains four steps:
//   1. Get beef
//   2. Cook the beef
//   3. Get buns for the burger
//   4. Put the cooked beef between the buns
//   5. Serve the burger (from the callback)
// We use callbacks here because each step is asynchronous.
//   We have to wait for the helper to complete the one step
//   before we can start the next step

const makeBurger = nextStep => {
  getBeef(function(beef) {
    cookBeef(beef, function(cookedBeef) {
      getBuns(function(buns) {
        putBeefBetweenBuns(buns, beef, function(burger) {
          nextStep(burger);
        });
      });
    });
  });
};


// 2) Second solution to callback hell: Split the callbacks into different functions
const getBeef = nextStep => {
  const fridge = leftFright;
  const beef = getBeefFromFridge(fridge);
  nextStep(beef);
};

const cookBeef = (beef, nextStep) => {
  const workInProgress = putBeefinOven(beef);
  setTimeout(function() {
    nextStep(workInProgress);
  }, 1000 * 60 * 20);
};


// 3) Third solution to callback hell: Use promises
const makeBurger = () => {
  return getBeef()
    .then(beef => cookBeef(beef))
    .then(cookedBeef => getBuns(beef))
    .then(bunsAndBeef => putBeefBetweenBuns(bunsAndBeef));
};

// Make and serve burger
makeBurger().then(burger => serve(burger));

const makeBurger = () => {
  return getBeef()
    .then(cookBeef)
    .then(getBuns)
    .then(putBeefBetweenBuns);
};

// Make and serve burger
makeBurger().then(serve);


// 4) Converting callbacks to promises
const getBeefPromise = _ => {
  const fridge = leftFright;
  const beef = getBeefFromFridge(fridge);
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (beef) {
      resolve(beef);
    } else {
      reject(new Error(“No more beef!”));
    }
  });
};

const cookBeefPromise = beef => {
  const workInProgress = putBeefinOven(beef);
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(workInProgress);
    }, 1000 * 60 * 20);
  });
};


// 5) Fourth solution to callback hell: Use asynchronous functions
const makeBurger = async () => {
  const beef = await getBeef();
  const cookedBeef = await cookBeef(beef);
  const buns = await getBuns();
  const burger = await putBeefBetweenBuns(cookedBeef, buns);
  return burger;
};

// Make and serve burger
makeBurger().then(serve);


const makeBurger = async () => {
  const [beef, buns] = await Promise.all(getBeef, getBuns);
  const cookedBeef = await cookBeef(beef);
  const burger = await putBeefBetweenBuns(cookedBeef, buns);
  return burger;
};

// Make and serve burger
makeBurger().then(serve);
```


Promise: An object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation. It is a container for a future value.


TDZ: Temporal Dead Zone is the period of time during which the let and const declarations cannot be accessed. Temporal Dead Zone starts when the code execution enters the block which contains the let or const declaration and continues until the declaration has executed.
